# Base Andromeda

* Unique to Andromeda Base is the use of a USDC wrapper, enabling USDC to be used as collateral for LPs, and for margin as perp traders.
* The configuration of Base Goerli can be seen [on Cannon](https://usecannon.com/packages/synthetix-omnibus/3.3.3-dev.e141cd8c/84531-andromeda)
* _Coming: Andromeda Base Sandbox - in the meantime see the more general_ [sandbox-with-perps.md](sandbox-with-perps.md "mention")
* Working timeline
  * Perps V3 in audit from Nov 6th
  * V3 Core mainnet release from Nov 13th
  * Perps V3 mainnet release from Nov 20th
